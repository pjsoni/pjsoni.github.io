WebMatrix is small downloadable package of 15MB only. It contains core WebMatrix editor, IIS Express, SQL Compact Edition and support for ASP.NET MVC. WebMatrix can be installed side-by-side with other editions of Visual Studio 2010 including Express editions.

WebMatrix also supports ASP.NET “Razor”, a new view engine for ASP.NET MVC. Currently, “Razor” is not included in to WebMatrix, and can be downloaded separately.  In future revisions of WebMatrix, “Razor” support will be included.
