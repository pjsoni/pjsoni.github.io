Today Microsoft released beta version of free tool for developing web application called “WebMatrix”. This tool targets all kind of developers from beginners to experienced. WebMatrix can be downloaded from WebMatrix download page.


WebMatrix is small downloadable package of 15MB only. It contains core WebMatrix editor, IIS Express, SQL Compact Edition and support for ASP.NET MVC. WebMatrix can be installed side-by-side with other editions of Visual Studio 2010 including Express editions.

WebMatrix also supports ASP.NET “Razor”, a new view engine for ASP.NET MVC. Currently, “Razor” is not included in to WebMatrix, and can be downloaded separately.  In future revisions of WebMatrix, “Razor” support will be included.

For more information on WebMatrix visit Scott Guthrie’s blog.
