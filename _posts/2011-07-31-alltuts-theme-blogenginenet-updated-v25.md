Previously Iâ€™ve published BlogEngine theme AllTuts based on original wordpress theme. This theme is now updated for BlogEngine v2.5 and added to the online gallery. Have a look and let me know your feedback.



BlogEngine v2.5 is having theme, widgets and extensions gallery integration. From the administration interface, you can browse the online gallery and install the desired items directly from the gallery. The gallery is utilizing NuGet package management for installing the packages. You can now install the theme from the online gallery. For installing you have to login through the administration interface and navigate to themes section. In themes section, you get the currently installed themes. Navigate to online gallery and select the theme and install to your blog and activate the theme as usual. If you prefer to install the theme manually, navigate to dnbegallery.org and download the theme and install theme in your BE installation.
