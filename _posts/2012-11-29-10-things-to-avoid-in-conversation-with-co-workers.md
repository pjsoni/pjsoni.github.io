Here are 10 things you should never say at work.

- “Are you pregnant?”
- “You owe $10 for this gift for the boss.”
- “You’re so skinny! Why aren’t you eating?”
- “That’s not my job.”
- “The new manager is a real jerk.”
- “I heard Kim is dating Ryan.”
- “You’re HOW old?”
- “Don’t ask me. They don’t tell me anything.”
- “Why are you so dressed up today? Got a job interview?”
- “I’m so hungover.”
