![Blogengine.net](/siteassets/images/benlogo80.gif){: .align-left} I’ve started the customization of [Blogengine.net](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/) for my upcoming site. I’ve considered this blog engine as my blog platform due to its highly customizable nature and good customizable theme support. My main goal is to customize this platform in such a way that it can handle simple blog to full fledged  content management system.

In upcoming days I’m coming with the detailed how-to series on the customization.

Happy blogging…
