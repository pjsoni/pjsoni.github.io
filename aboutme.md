### My story

My name is Pravesh Soni and Iâ€™m software professional. I got involved with computers since last two decades starting with playing games developed in BASIC. I am a tech enthusiast and I love writing code, blogging, science fiction, cartoons, music, robotics and I am a big Microsoft fan too.

I started programming in classic asp but later switch to .net and now at present I have almost 17 years of development experience in Microsoft technologies. I got involved in customized software development in my career of programming, now contributing to some open source community development.

At present I work for a fortune 100 corporation where by day I write some creepy business logic which is not the best work yet.
